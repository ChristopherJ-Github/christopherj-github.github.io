							<p>	
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1419360/Hyper_Psychic_Gauntlets/?beta=1" target="_blank">Hyper Psychic Gauntlets</a> is an unorthodox VR bullet hell where you have nothing but two telekinetic gauntlets to defend yourself against the guardians of the temple. Dodge lasers, deflect bullets and throw around enemies as you prove you're worthy as the wielder of the gauntlets. Between split second thinking  deciding whether to dodge or deflect and the constant movement needed to weave yourself around lasers and bullets, you'll be drowning in sweat by the time you take off your headset.			
	</p>
							<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>After creating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/914450/Test_Subject_901/" target="_blank">Test Subject 901</a>, a horror game where the player was pretty much defenceless, we wanted to create an over the top action game that made the player feel powerful.
We were inspired a lot by Devils Daggers because of how fun they managed to make the game with just one arena.
After a bunch of prototypes we ended up with a bullet hell where you could teleport around an arena and shoot down enemies as they spawned
endlessly. As fun as it was, it was way too hard for a normal player without checkpoints and even if we were to balance it out we didn't think we could expand much onto it.
<br><br>
We went back to the drawing board and ended up giving the player a telekentic weapon on one hand and a gun in the other and breaking things into stages.
Teleporting also didn't seem to add much to the experience and made things cumbersome so we removed that and focused all action in front of the player. 
The game got a lot better but we realized it would be even cooler if we just gave the player two tekelentic weapons and built the game around that.
We took a lot of inspiration from Blasters of the Universe but at the same time made sure not to step on their toes. 
In a regular bullet hell there's a lot of focus on dodging and weaving your way through various patterns of bullets but since the player could grab bullets in our game we put a focus on reaction time rather than careful dodging.
<br><br>
In Hyper Psychic Gauntlets, your main form of combat is grabbing. 
Enemies and bullets are yellow meaning you can grab them and once you grab them they turn blue meaning they're under your control. If you grab a bullet you can throw it back, if you grab an enemy then it turns
into a weapon. You can only hold an enemy for a few seconds before it breaks so you'll need to be constantly grabbing enemies and throwing projectiles to survive. There's no limit on how many things you grab at once, as long is it's within
your ray's range, you can grab it.

<h2 id="history">Breakdown</h2>
<p><a href="./files/screenshot0.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./files/screenshot0.jpg"></a> <br><br>
As you progress through the game more enemies are mixed in.
For example, in stage 2 a laser shooting enemy is added that gradually moves towards you. 
You can't grab the laser itself, so you'll need to quickly to find the source of the laser and grab it to disarm it. 
It's easy at first but once there's a ton of them ramming towards you it becomes a challenge as you're constantly switching between ducking and disarming.
<p><a href="./files/HighresScreenshot00435.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./files/HighresScreenshot00435.jpg"></a> <br><br>
By level 2 we added in what we call 'the splitter' enemy. 
It's a cute cube that runs out of energy and dies after a few seconds, but if you accidently grab it before that it'll split into a bunch of tiny laser shooting cubes. It's not insta-death but you can assume you're dead if you aren't confident in dodging. 
At this point the player can't get away with just randomly destroying everything they see and need to be careful with what they grab while dodging and attacking as fast as they can.
<p><a href="./files/HighresScreenshot00103.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./files/HighresScreenshot00103.jpg"></a> <br><br>
To balance out the splitter in level 2 the player gains the ability to smash down a meteorite and clear the map. It was mainly added in for balancing but the real reason we added it in was because giant explosions are cool. 
You can throw down a meteorite twice in casual mode and once in normal mode. 
<br><br>
The scoring system was balanced to reward players who use more variation. 
For example, you'd get a higher score by deflecting projectiles and smashing enemies than if you were to just smash all enemies until the end. 
You also get more points for clearing the stage faster so you could still get a high score by just being fast, but if you want reach the top ranks you'll need to do a combination of both.
<p><a href="./files/HighresScreenshot00510.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./files/HighresScreenshot00510.jpg"></a> <br><br>
In the boss fights the focus is changed to dodging. 
Bosses use mainly laser attacks in specific patterns and you're given various chances to retalite when the boss shoots at you or summons enemies that you can use as weapons.

			<h2 id="history">About Us</h2>
			<p>SpinVR is a studio focused on augmented and virtual reality in partnership with SpinVFX. 
			We've created 360 experiences such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd4kHG6PJWQ&feature=emb_title" target="blank">The Expanse: Battle on Mars</a> and developed games such <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/914450/Test_Subject_901/" target="_blank">Test Subject 901</a>. 
			Recently we've been polishing our web VR platform, <a href="https://experience.briovr.com/" target="blank">BrioVR</a>. 
			BrioVR lets people create VR and AR experiences easily without using any code.
			It really shines when used to display models with added customization. 
			For example, you can make <a href="https://www.experience.briovr.com/blog/aston-martin/" target="blank">a car showcase and animate the materials so you can show off all colors.</a> 
			We even used the platform while collaborating online to get an idea of how the assets would look like in-game without having to actually create a new game build each time we wanted a change.
